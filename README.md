## About CSL204 Operating Systems Lab

This course focuses on providing practical experience in understanding and implementing various concepts and algorithms in operating systems. From system calls to deadlock avoidance, the course covers a wide range of topics aimed at providing hands-on experience in operating system principles.

## Course Outcomes

1. Understand the use of system calls in operating systems.
2. Apply process creation and inter-process communication concepts.
3. Implement CPU scheduling algorithms including FCFS, SJF, RR, and priority-based scheduling.
4. Apply page replacement algorithms such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU.
5. Apply deadlock detection and avoidance techniques.
6. Apply storage management and disk scheduling techniques.
